However, it is highly treatable with hearing aids. Conductive hearing loss (e.g., earwax, infection) can sometimes be medically reversed."},{q:"Does hearing loss always get worse?",a:"Not necessarily. Age-related hearing loss is progressive but slow. Protecting your ears from loud noise and managing health conditions can slow its progression."}]},{category:"Hearing Aids",questions:[{q:"Will hearing aids restore my hearing to normal?",a:"No device can fully restore 'normal' hearing. However, modern hearing aids significantly improve your ability to hear speech, filter background noise, and connect with the world."},{q:"Do I really need two hearing aids?",a:"If you have hearing loss in both ears, yes. Two aids help your brain localize sound, understand speech in noise, and maintain balance. It’s how your brain is designed to work."},{q:"Are hearing aids only for old people?",a:"Absolutely not. Hearing loss affects people of all ages due to genetics, noise exposure, and illness. Treating it is a sign of taking care of your health, just like wearing glasses."}]},{category:"Process",questions:[{q:"Do I need a doctor's referral?",a:"You can book directly with us for a hearing assessment. If we detect medical flags (like infection), we will refer you to an ENT specialist."},{q:"How long does a hearing test take?",a:"A comprehensive assessment typically takes about 45-60 minutes.
