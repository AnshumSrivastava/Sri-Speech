However, it is highly treatable with hearing aids. Conductive hearing loss (e.g., earwax, infection) can sometimes be medically reversed."},{q:"Does hearing loss always get worse?",a:"Not necessarily. Age-related hearing loss is progressive but slow. Protecting your ears from loud noise and managing health conditions can slow its progression."}]},{category:"Hearing Aids",questions:[{q:"Will hearing aids restore my hearing to normal?",a:"No device can fully restore 'normal' hearing. However, modern hearing aids significantly improve your ability to hear speech, filter background noise, and connect with the world."},{q:"Do I really need two hearing aids?",a:"If you have hearing loss in both ears, yes. Two aids help your brain localize sound, understand speech in noise, and maintain balance. It’s how your brain is designed to work."},{q:"Are hearing aids only for old people?",a:"Absolutely not. Hearing loss affects people of all ages due to genetics, noise exposure, and illness. Treating it is a sign of taking care of your health, just like wearing glasses."}]},{category:"Process",questions:[{q:"Do I need a doctor's referral?",a:"You can book directly with us for a hearing assessment. If we detect medical flags (like infection), we will refer you to an ENT specialist."},{q:"How long does a hearing test take?",a:"A comprehensive assessment typically takes about 45-60 minutes. It is painless and thorough."}]}];function $(o){W(t,a(t)===o?null:o)}var u=ee();J(o=>{var l=R();B.title="Frequently Asked Questions | Sri Speech & Hearing Aid Centre",i(o,l)});var p=r(s(u),2);I(p,5,()=>m,H,(o,l,S)=>{var v=Z(),h=s(v),T=s(h,!0);e(h);var k=r(h,2);I(k,5,()=>a(l).questions,H,(j,A,D)=>{const g=F(()=>`${S}-${D}`);var f=X(),d=s(f);d.__click=[U,$,g];var b=s(d),N=s(b,!0);e(b);var E=r(b,2);e(d);var P=r(d,2);{var Q=x=>{var y=V(),z=s(y,!0);e(y),c(()=>w(z,a(A).a)),i(x,y)};G(P,x=>{a(t)===a(g)&&x(Q)})}e(f),c(()=>{w(N,a(A).q),M(E,1,`text-blue-500 transform transition-transform duration-300 ${a(t)===a(g)?"rotate-180":""}`)}),i(j,f)}),e(k),e(v),c(()=>w(T,a(l).category)),i(o,v)}),e(p);var q=r(p,2),C=r(s(q),4);e(q),e(u),c(()=>K(C,"href",`${O??""}/book`)),i(_,u)}Y(["click"]);export{me as component};
